"THE PIZZA-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 420):
Mrucznik <mrucznik@gmail.com> wrote most of these files. As long as you
retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we
meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a
pizza in return.
Exception! If you are a government organization and want to use these files, 
you cannot until you stop collect taxes.
